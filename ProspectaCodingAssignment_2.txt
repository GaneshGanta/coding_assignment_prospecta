2Q)Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

This can be represented in an Excel sheet below:

A    B     C

1    5     3        =5+A1

2    7     8        =A2+B2

3    9     =4+5     =C2+B3


I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with the results. If it is a value, then return a value. 
If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.

1. How will you tackle the challenge above?

Ans:

a. At first we will take the input of data using a scanner class or buffer reader.

b. Then we will split data using comma (,) and make it into an array.

c. Then we will create HashMap and put the field name as Key and formula or value as Data.

d. Then we can simplify HashMap values by parsing them into integers if it is a value or fetching field values if it is the formula.

e. After this, we can convert the map into a CSV file.



2. What type of errors you would you check for?

Ans :

a. We may encounter Circular dependency if 2 fields are dependent on each other.

b. We may get a Null pointer exception if the value is not present on the value in the hashmap.

c. Wrong cell references as per CSV file : (e.g. A5 or D1 for the given case is invalid cell reference).

d. Wrong syntax for the formula: â€œ+B1".




3. How might a user break your code?

Ans :

Following ways users can break our code :

a)By inputting invalid CSV format: not separating with commas properly.

b)By using incorrect cell references in formulas.

c)By using unsupported functions or formulas.

d)By using providing invalid data types: non-numeric values in cells that are expected to contain numbers.
